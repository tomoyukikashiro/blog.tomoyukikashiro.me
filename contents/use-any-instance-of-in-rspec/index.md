You can use stub like this.

```ruby
user.stub(:name).and_return("example")
```

But you can not use stub method to non-initialize object which is initialize in application logic (e.g. ApplicationController)
In this case you need to use `any_instance_of` method.

```ruby
ApplicationController.any_instance_of.stub(:auth?).and_return(true)
```
