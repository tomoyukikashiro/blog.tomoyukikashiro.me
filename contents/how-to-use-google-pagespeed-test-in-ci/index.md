## Motivation

You know site performance is important for SEO, Conversion but it is difficult to find how to test it continuously. (It was difficult for me...).
So I will explain how to set up peformance test in CI using [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/).

## Outline

I will explain continuous performance test settings using Google PageSpeed Insights in Travis CI with heroku.
Application I want to test is [this blog](https://blog.tomoyukikashiro.me) which is generated by [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) so the application is totally static site (no need DB and server side program).

- Heroku app
- Travis CI connected with github repository

Basic flow is below.

- 1 Make PR in github repository
- 2 Start test process in Travis CI
    - 1 Install depandencies
    - 2 Build application
    - 3 Push built application to heroku
    - 4 Run Google Page Insight test 

## Prepare heroku

First step is setup heroku for test the application.

```bash
$ mkdir ${app_name}
$ cd ${app_name}
$ git init
$ heroku apps:create ${app_name}
```

This [article](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/deploy-static-site-heroku) could be good reference to make static server on heroku !

## Edit CI settings

Second step is setup travis CI.
You can see travis CI settings for repository like below.

> https://travis-ci.org/${account_name}/${repository_name}/settings

You need those settings in `Environment Variables` section.

- HEROKU_API_KEY
- TEST_SITE_GIT_REMOTE
- TEST_SITE_URL

### HEROKU_API_KEY

Heroku app is git repository and it's private so to clone it in travis server you need this token.
You can see it thru this command.

``bash
$ heroku auth:token
``

### TEST_SITE_GIT_REMOTE

heroku app git url. git protocol would be better `git@heroku.com:${app_name}.git` instead of https protocol not to be asked id/password everytime.

### TEST_SITE_URL

heroku app url to test.


## Edit CI tasks

Basic `travis.yml` is here.
You need replace `${your install process here}` and `${your build process here}` for your application

```yml
sudo: required
language: node_js
node_js:
  - "7"
install:
  - ${your install process here}
  - npm install
  - scripts/setup_heroku.sh
  - git clone $TEST_SITE_GIT_REMOTE output
before_script:
  - ${your build process here}
  - cd output && git add --ignore-removal . && git commit -m 'deploy for test' && git push origin master -f && cd -
script:
  - npm test $TEST_SITE_URL
after_script:
  - heroku keys:clear
```

### setup_heroku.sh

[setup_heroku.sh](https://github.com/tomoyukikashiro/blog.tomoyukikashiro.me/blob/master/scripts/setup_heroku.sh)

This script add `ssh private key` to heroku to clone repository thu heroku CLI.

I use nodejs heroku command which [is not recommended](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#npm-version) by heroku because I could not install other installation methods...
If you have idea let me know!

### npm test $TEST_SITE_URL

```json
   "devDependencies": {
    "psi": "^3.0.0"
  }, 
  "scripts": {
    "test": "npm run test_psi",
    "test_psi": "psi --strategy mobile"
  },
```

[psi](https://github.com/addyosmani/psi) is npm module to do Google pageSpeed Insights.
